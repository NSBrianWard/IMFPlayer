# IMFPlayer
A macOS port (arm64 & x86_64)!

It's been a while since I've updated this project, but I've fixed it. It should compile and go in Xcode without too much fuss. Tested on macOS 26.2 (the latest as of this commit). You can obtain SDL2 from homebrew: https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/sdl2

I tossed this together a while back, but I'm pretty sure this is where I got the source files for the Win/Linux version: http://sourceforge.net/projects/clonekeenplus/files/Tools/IMFPlayer/
