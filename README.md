# IMFPlayer
A Mac OS X port!

Should compile and go in Xcode without too much fuss. Tested on Mac OS X 10.10. You'll probably need to move `SDL.framework` to `/Library/Frameworks` in order to get it to launch.

I tossed this together a while back, but I'm pretty sure this is where I got the source files for the Win/Linux version: http://sourceforge.net/projects/clonekeenplus/files/Tools/IMFPlayer/
